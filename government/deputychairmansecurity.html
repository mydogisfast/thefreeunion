    <h4>
      About
    </h4>
    <br />
    <p>
      Ben Gaunt, Deputy Chairman of State Security of the Free Union, is a
      loyal, tough, and intellegent political officer. He leads the Committee
      for State Security with an iron fist, and works valiantly to brings
      terrorists and anti-unionists to justice.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ben Gaunt, born in 2007, was a high ranking federal police officer under
      the United States Government. Although he certainly did not agree with
      their capitalistic ideals, he needed to get money somehow to feed his
      family. But, when the people's army requested assistance from him, he
      decided to use the US police forces to help the revolution before his
      superiors even knew what happened.
      <br />
      <br />
      After the revolution, Chairman of State Security Lara Santas, as reward
      for his commendabe efforts, appointed him as his deputy. Without Ben Gaunt,
      the Committee for State Security could not possibly be as efficient and
      rigid as it is today.
