        About
      </h4>
      <p>
        Chace Smith, head of government in the Free Union, is a man with
        superior intellect and efficiency to manage the government with a firm
        hand. His loyalties, of course, lie with the free union and it's people,
        and will never let them down.
        <br />
        <br />
        Chace Smith, born in 2007 to a poor peasant family in the east, knew
        from an early age of the terrible ways the ruling class would exploit
        the working class for their own monitary gain at the expense of people
        like Chace. When he was but 15 years old, he decided to do something
        about it. He joined the People's Revolutionary Army, and quickly rose
        through the ranks. Soon, he was in charge of his own brigade. At the
        approval of general Jameson Foreman, he launched an all out attack on
        his house, expelling the imperialistic US forces stationed there, and
        the ruling class with them.
        <br />
        <br />
        When General Jameson Foreman of the Peoples' Revolutionary Army caught
        wind of the news, he sent a letter to the United States of America,
        requesting them to officially cede Chace's house to the Revolutionary
        Army. Fearing a scandal, President Joe Biden silently approved the
        succession. With that, the Free Union was officially formed, consisting
        of Chace's house, and it's corresponding backyard.
        <br />
        <br />
        Due to Chace's military efficiency, and his ability to lead ruthlessly
        and effectively, the newly appointed General Secretary, Jameson Foreman,
        appointed Chace as the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Free
        Union (premier.) He holds the position to this day, and is vital to the
        nation's success.
